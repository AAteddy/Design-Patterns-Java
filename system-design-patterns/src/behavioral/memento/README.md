# **Introduction to the Memento Pattern**

## **What is the Memento Pattern?**

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. It's often compared to the "undo" feature in software applications. This pattern saves the state of an object without exposing its internal structure, ensuring encapsulation.

## **What problem does it solve?**

The Memento pattern solves the problem of how to restore an object to a previous state without violating encapsulation. Sometimes in software, you want to allow users or systems to "undo" or "rollback" changes. However, you don’t want the outside world (other objects) to access the internal details of your object. The Memento pattern provides a way to save an object's internal state and restore it later without exposing the object's internals.

## **Where does it fit in Object-Oriented Programming?**

The Memento pattern is a behavioral pattern, which means it focuses on how objects interact and share responsibility. It’s particularly useful when you want to save and restore the state of an object and when that state is complex enough that using a simpler solution (like manually saving each field) would violate encapsulation or lead to hard-to-maintain code.
