# **Introduction to the State Pattern**

## **What is the State Pattern?**

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object can have many different behaviors depending on its current state. The key idea is to represent each state as a separate class and delegate the state-specific behavior to these classes.

## **What Problem Does It Solve?**

In many systems, the behavior of an object depends on its state. For example, a vending machine behaves differently depending on whether it's idle, waiting for money, or dispensing a product. Without the State Pattern, the object's behavior would likely be implemented using messy if-else or switch statements scattered throughout the codebase.

The State Pattern solves this by organizing the state-specific behavior into different classes, making the code more maintainable and scalable. It also allows you to easily add new states without modifying existing code (which follows the Open/Closed Principle of SOLID).

## **Where Does It Fit in Object-Oriented Programming?**

The State Pattern is a behavioral pattern and it focuses on the object's internal state to determine its behavior. Itâ€™s closely related to other patterns like the Strategy Pattern, but while Strategy focuses on selecting algorithms, the State Pattern focuses on changing behavior based on the state of the object.
